This repository contains a collection of codes implemented in Maude System, a rewriting logic-based specification and programming language. The main examples include the implementation of common data structures such as binary trees and lists, as well as basic algorithms like factorial calculation. Additionally, the repository includes a more complex project, in which a slice request is modeled and manipulated using the rewriting logic capabilities of the Maude System.
